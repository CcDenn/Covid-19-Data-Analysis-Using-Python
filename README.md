# Covid-19-Data-Analysis-Using-Python

In this project, we aim to explore the potential relationship between the spread of the coronavirus in a country and the overall happiness levels of its residents. To achieve this, we will be working with two primary datasets: the Covid19 Dataset provided by John Hopkins University, which contains information on the cumulative number of confirmed cases per day in different countries, and the World Happiness Report, an annual publication by the United Nations that includes scores given by individuals living in various countries based on different life factors.

Objective: The main objective of this project is to determine whether a correlation exists between the spread of COVID-19 in a country and the happiness levels reported by its inhabitants. By merging the Covid19 Dataset and the World Happiness Report, we will calculate a measure that can shed light on this relationship. Additionally, we will visualize the results to gain a better understanding of the data.

The analysis has yielded an intriguing finding indicating that individuals residing in developed countries exhibit a higher susceptibility to contracting the coronavirus compared to those in less developed countries. While this observation suggests a possible link between development status and infection rates, it is important to note that the current data does not provide definitive evidence to establish causation. One plausible explanation for this discrepancy could be the limited availability of Corona test kits in less developed countries. However, further research and additional data are necessary to ascertain the precise factors contributing to the observed trend.
